## User Story

AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

## MockUp

## Files and Images


## Usage 

Express, mongoose, jest, nodemon

## Installation

This is a backend program, therefore, it needs to be run in Insomnia.  To run you must install: 
A npm i dotenv must also be run. Then do an npm i and an npm start.
Once the packages are installed open Insomnia to view the databases.

## Credits
